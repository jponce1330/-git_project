			<p>The team was established as the Seattle SuperSonics in 1967. 
			They relocated in 2008 after a settlement was reached between the 
			ownership group led by Clay Bennett and lawmakers in Seattle, Washington 
			following a lawsuit. As the SuperSonics, the franchise qualified for the 
			NBA Playoffs 22 times, won their division six times, and won the 1979 
			NBA Championship. In Oklahoma City, the Thunder qualified for their first 
			playoff berth during the 2009–10 season. They followed that success by 
			winning their first division title as the Thunder in the 2010–11 season 
			and their first Western Conference championship as the Thunder in the 
			2011–12 season, appearing in the NBA Finals for the fourth time in 
			franchise history and first since 1996, when the club was based 
			in Seattle.</p>

			<p>The Thunder's previous incarnation, the Seattle SuperSonics, were formed 
			in 1967. In their 41 years in Seattle, the SuperSonics compiled a 1,745–1,585 
			(.524) win–loss record in the regular season and 107–110 (.493) in the playoffs. 
			The franchise's titles include three Western Conference championships and one NBA 
			title in 1979.</p>
